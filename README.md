# iPhoneX-DevTut

Then you’ll explore how to fix an app that was created shortly before the iPhone X announcement: is it enough to just turn on safe area? Read on to find out.

**Rule**: Compose your images so you don’t lose important visual information when Aspect Fill crops them.

### Designing a New App

**Rules**

- Avoid the sensor housing and home indicator, except for background image and vertically scrollable views.
- Avoid placing controls where the home indicator overlaps, or corners crop.
- Don’t hide or draw attention to sensor housing, corners or home indicator.

### Use Auto Layout

**Rules**

- Use safe area layout guides.
- Use margin layout guides.
- Center content or inset it symmetrically.

### Use Standard UI Elements

**Recommendation**: Use standard UI elements.

**Note**: The iPhone X is compact width in landscape orientation, so it behaves like the iPhone 8, not the 8 Plus.
